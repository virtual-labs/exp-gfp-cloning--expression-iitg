### About the Experiment 

Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is a widely used tool in molecular and cellular biology due to its ability to fluoresce green when exposed to light in the blue to ultraviolet range. GFP has applications, which include being used as a reporter gene to monitor the expression of other genes. It can also be fused to other proteins to study their localization within a cell.
